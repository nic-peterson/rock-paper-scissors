# rock-paper-scissors
Created a 5 round version of a rock paper scissors game. The computer randomly chooses rock, paper, or scissors. The user is prompted to make their choice. A winner is determined each round with a final score shared at the end. 

There's an opportunity for some more data validation. But otherwise, it's in good working order!
